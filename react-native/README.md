# React Native Technical Assessment

## Objective
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate your skills in React Native development by converting a given Figma design into a functional mobile application. 
Additionally, you will be required to consume a basic API endpoint and display the data accordingly in the application.

## Requirements
- Convert the provided Figma design into a React Native application.
- Consume the provided RESTful API endpoint to fetch data.
- Display the fetched data in a meaningful way according to the design.
- Ensure the application is responsive, pixel-perfect and follows best practices for React Native development.
- Write clean, fully-typed, readable, and maintainable code.
- Provide adequate documentation and instructions for running the application.

## Figma Design
[Link to Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/D3UmIfKhuNwwRXatWBgENW/react-native-assessment?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=OuLiE6LT9VgHyo7Z-1)

## API Endpoint
The API endpoint for fetching data is: [API Endpoint](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)

## Instructions
- Set up a new development environment for React Native (Expo).
- Implement the Figma design using React Native components.
- Fetch data from the provided API endpoint and display it in the application.
- For the Date and status
- **App Flow:**
   - Validate user input on the Login screen (No need to consume an endpoint for the login).
   - If the validation passes (user inputs a valid email and password), navigate to the next screen.
   - Fetch the list of todos from the endpoint and display them accordingly.
   - For the user status (Pending/Active), randomly generate them and attach to the user object / API response.
- Test the application thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.
- Document any additional steps required to run the application or notes about your implementation.

## Technologies
- Expo
- Typescript
- Axios / Fetch

## Submission
- Submit your completed assessment by pushing your code to a public repository and share the link on Whatsapp.
- Due to the urgency of the role, submissions received beyond the specified deadline of 3 days will not be accepted.
